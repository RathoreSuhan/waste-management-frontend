/**
 * ============================================================================
 * Municipal Officer constants
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Vocabulary of the municipal approval workspace, kept in one place so the
 * dashboard, the queues and the decision dialog can never drift apart.
 *
 * Two backend enums are mirrored here:
 *   ApprovalStage    -> PROPOSAL | COMPLETION
 *   ApprovalDecision -> APPROVED | REJECTED | REVISION_REQUIRED | REVISION_SUBMITTED
 *
 * The same three decisions mean very different things at the two stages, which
 * is why the action buttons are described per stage instead of per decision:
 *
 *   PROPOSAL stage
 *     APPROVED          -> authorise this cleaner, the site becomes ASSIGNED
 *     REVISION_REQUIRED -> ask the cleaner to improve and resubmit the plan
 *     REJECTED          -> turn this plan down
 *
 *   COMPLETION stage
 *     APPROVED          -> sign the work off: COMPLETED + report RESOLVED + reward
 *     REVISION_REQUIRED -> send it back as REWORK_REQUIRED, cleaner continues
 *     REJECTED          -> refuse the evidence, also parks it in REWORK_REQUIRED
 *
 * A rejected completion never ends the job: the cleaner keeps working, logs
 * more diary entries and re-submits proof, which runs GPS + AI again and lands
 * back in this officer's completion queue.
